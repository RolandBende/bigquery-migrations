# SECURITY POLICY

## Supported Versions

After each new major release, the previous release won't be supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this package, please send an email to benderoland+bigquery-migrations-security@gmail.com.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster.

Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly until a fix has been announced.
